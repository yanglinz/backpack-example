# Backpack ðŸŽ’

Backpack is a tool I made for personal project that helps me sharing development
and runtime configuration for docker based applications.

Mechanically, it's a meant to be hosted in application repositories as a
[git subtree](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-subtree), and
functions as CLI tool that ties together bash scripts and configuration files.

> NOTE: Backpack is made for my personal use, and is very specific to my own

> source it because the pattern of embedding a set of configuration as a
> packaged tool has worked for me very well over time.
