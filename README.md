# ðŸŽ’Backpack Example

This is an example app that embeds
[backpack](https://github.com/yanglinz/backpack), which is a tool I wrote to
share a set of common infrastructure configuration for some personal projects.

This particular example is a hello world
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) application deployed to
[Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run), which is a serverless
container runtime.
